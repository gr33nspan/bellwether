	  <!--ABOUT-->
	  <div class="wrapper text" id="about">
		<h2>/** ABOUT **/</h2>
		<p class=""><i>BELLWETHER</i> is a podcast of speculative journalism created. Bellwether presents stories of the world as it is through the lens of what it might become: in-depth longform nonfiction, told within the frame of an ongoing sci-fi radio serial. </p> 

    <p>Within the show’s nonfiction, host Sam Greenspan reports true stories of collisions with technology. A person is killed by a self-driving car. An online hate forum weaponizes municipal code compliance officers. A moral panic results in legislation that is collapsing the internet. A 404 “Page Not Found” error initiates a medical disaster. The stories are, in a sense, true stories of real people caught in real-world dystopias</p>

    <p>Bellwether’s fiction centers on Cass (Carmen Berkeley), the sentient A.I. companion of a human named Icarus. The pair are currently in the largest city in North America (Phoenix, Arizona), holed up in short-term cryogenic freezing (it’s the only place they can afford). They’re doing gig work for the “Cloudburst Truth & Reconciliation Commission”—a joint effort of A.I. and humans (or biological intelligence, or “B.I.”) to figure out what caused the internet to permanently disappear two decades prior.</p>

    <p>Cass and Icarus’s job is to sift through the wreckage of the internet, and tag anything interesting they come across. Cass, the curious A.I. is in heaven surrounded by all this data. But Icarus is homesick; he is sustained on “copperwire” voice messages left for him by his family back in Kansas: Icarus’s moms (Katie Malia and Pooya Mohseni), his Uncle Ernie (Michael Chernus), and his grandparent (Keith Randolph Smith).</p>

    <p>Icarus resolves to quit the Cloudburst T&RC and bring the pair back to Kansas. But on their last night on the job, Cass and Icarus come across a few artifacts—episodes of an old early-21st Century “podcast” called Bellwether. They begin to wonder if Bellwether might hold clues to figuring out what happened to the world—and maybe, how to save it.</p>
