	  <!--ABOUT-->
	  <div class="wrapper text" id="about">
		<h2>/** ABOUT **/</h2>
		<p class=""><i>BELLWETHER</i> is a podcast of speculative journalism created. Bellwether presents stories of the world as it is through the lens of what it might become: in-depth longform nonfiction, told within the frame of an ongoing sci-fi radio serial. </p> 

    <p>Within the show‚Äôs nonfiction, host Sam Greenspan reports true stories of collisions with technology. A person is killed by a self-driving car. An online hate forum weaponizes municipal code compliance officers. A moral panic results in legislation that is collapsing the internet. A 404 ‚ÄúPage Not Found‚Äù error initiates a medical disaster. The stories are, in a sense, true stories of real people caught in real-world dystopias</p>

    <p>Bellwether‚Äôs fiction centers on Cass (Carmen Berkeley), the sentient A.I. companion of a human named Icarus. The pair are currently in the largest city in North America (Phoenix, Arizona), holed up in short-term cryogenic freezing (it‚Äôs the only place they can afford). They‚Äôre doing gig work for the ‚ÄúCloudburst Truth & Reconciliation Commission‚Äù‚Äîa joint effort of A.I. and humans (or biological intelligence, or ‚ÄúB.I.‚Äù) to figure out what caused the internet to permanently disappear two decades prior.</p>

    <p>Cass and Icarus‚Äôs job is to sift through the wreckage of the internet, and tag anything interesting they come across. Cass, the curious A.I. is in heaven surrounded by all this data. But Icarus is homesick; he is sustained on ‚Äúcopperwire‚Äù voice messages left for him by his family back in Kansas: Icarus‚Äôs moms (Katie Malia and Pooya Mohseni), his Uncle Ernie (Michael Chernus), and his grandparent (Keith Randolph Smith).</p>

    <p>Icarus resolves to quit the Cloudburst T&RC and bring the pair back to Kansas. But on their last night on the job, Cass and Icarus come across a few artifacts‚Äîepisodes of an old early-21st Century ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù called Bellwether. They begin to wonder if Bellwether might hold clues to figuring out what happened to the world‚Äîand maybe, how to save it.</p>

    <p><i>Bellwether was created with support from: </br>
    The 1,047 backers of the 2018 Kickstarter Campaign üîî The Institute for the Future üîî The Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University üîî The Shuttleworth Foundation üîî The Joshua Tree Highlands Artist Residency üîî The Paycheck Protection Program üîî The Economic Injury Disaster Loan üîî Pandemic Unemployment Assistance üîî The national eviction moratorium</i></p>

    <p>Bellwether is created by Sam Greenspan, and co-written and co-directed with Alex Barron</p>

    <p>SAM GREENSPAN is the creator of <i>BELLWETHER</i>, a podcast of speculative journalism. An award-winning radio reporter, producer and artist, Sam has been an active member in the public radio and podcast space for more than 15 years making radio.

Sam also helped launch NPR‚Äôs <i>TED Radio Hour</i>, USA Today‚Äôs <i>The City</i>, Radiotopia‚Äôs <i>Spacebridge</i>, among others. Sam grew up in Florida and now lives in Los Angeles with their dog, Neon.</p>
