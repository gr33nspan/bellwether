    In a moment when reality is stranger than fiction,

    when journalists cannot take for granted that thorough reporting will be believed,

    when the stakes are higher than ever,

    and when the future happens so fast&#65279;â€”

    we need new tools to tell the stories of our time.
- content: |-
    We need a kind of speculative journalism:

    stories of the world as it is
    through the lens of what it might become.

    I'm Sam Greenspan. This is Bellwether.

    Coming soon.
